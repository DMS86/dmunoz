							<h1>Codesigning Technology with Parents and Children</h1>
							<p class="major">I’m looking for participants for a 1.5-hour study about how adult children and parents communicate through technologies after the child has left home. There’s a reward for parent and child (a $50 voucher each).</p>

									<h3>The workshop</h3>
									<p>You will do a card sorting activity, play a TV show based game, and then build a Magical device to be in touch with your parent or child. We will end with a discussion on how to build a real technology to enrich your relationship based on your own thoughts and reflections.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon style2 major fa-thumbs-up"></span>
									<h3>Expected Benefits</h3>
									<p>It is expected that this project will not benefit you directly. However, the activities in which you will participate can provide insights and reflection about your own experiences, and the outcomes of this research will benefit other parents that will live this transition in the future.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon style2 major fa-medkit"></span>
									<h3>Risks</h3>
									<p>We believe the only risk would be to feel uncomfortable or embarrassed during the workshop because you would have to share personal information or perform an activity related to your personal life. Your participation is completely voluntary and you can withdraw at any time if you want.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon style2 major fa-check-circle"></span>
									<h3>Confidentiality</h3>
									<p>All comments and responses will be treated confidentially unless required by law. The names of individual persons are not required in any of the responses.</p>

									<h3>Reward</h3>
									<p>To recognise your contribution should you choose to participate, the research team is offering an incentive that consists of a $50 Coles Group &amp; Myer Gift Card if you choose the first option, and a $50 Coles Group &amp; Myer Gift Card if you choose the second option.</p>
